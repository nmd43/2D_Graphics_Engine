# 2D Graphics Engine

## Contributors: Nikita Daga | Supplementary code: Mike Reed

## Features: 

* This is a 2D Graphics engine that can be used to draw rectangles, triangles, circles, cubic and quadrartic curves, and all convex and concave polygons. 
* These shapes can be filled with different colors, blend modes, opacities, and shading techniques.
* Matrices are used to tranform the images drawn so they can be rotated, inverted, scaled in size, and translated in position. 
* The shapes can be defined in any contour and can be traced correctly and clipped to appropriately fit within the screen.
* Tiling modes for the images are also available (clamp, repeat, and mirror). 
* Different textures can be provided for each vertex to create a traingular or quadrilateral textured mesh.
* All code is optimized to ensure that the graphics engine can render images in a timely manner.
